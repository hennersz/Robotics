CHANGELOG for RoboSim, 2014

2.0.2: 
   - Handle reception of a non-unicode character on the control
     connection by closing the connection rather than throwing an
     uncaught exception and crashing.

2.0.3:
   - implement random underreads
   - Set SO_REUSE_ADDR on control socket to avoid timewait
   - poll control connection more often (was only 30 ops/sec, now around 120).

2.0.4:
   - increase max command rate to 150 ops/sec.
   - now also calculate the encoder values 150 times/sec
   - fix bug that resulted in motor speeds taking longer than they
     should to settle to target speed.
