For task 4 Axel and I both created the code for creating, adding and traversing linked lists during one of the labs before reading week. During reading week we both worked on an initial attempt at following the linked list back to the start of the track although we were unsuccessful although we were close.After the first lecture after reading week we both understood what we needed to do better and I wrote an initial working version of task 4, some of which was based on the code we wrote in reading week. In the thursday lab we both worked on the code to make it work on the robot, this was mostly changing constants until we were succsessful.
