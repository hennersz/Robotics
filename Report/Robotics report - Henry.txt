Robotics report
Mine and my partners’ involvement for the duration of this module has been fairly even. For the final task most code was either brought back from previous tasks or we would meet up and write the code together so we both understood how it worked and what was going on. There are portions of code that were written separately but we would often improve upon these greatly later. Axel initially wrote code for the first phase. I then improved on it and we continued to add to it together to produce the final solution. Mapping code and linked list code were both written by us during previous tasks and some of it was adapted for use during this task. The turning code was rewritten by Axel as our old code wasn’t good enough. I got the code to follow a list of points working properly. Axel also wrote the print maze code. I wrote code we could use to calibrate the robot before racing so we could adjust constants properly and also wrote code that ran at the beginning that allowed the robot to see where it is within the starting square. As you can see we both contributed equally to the project. I was very pleased with my partners efforts and I think he feels the same way.
