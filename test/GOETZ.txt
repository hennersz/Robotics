During the lab class before reading week, Henry and I, both worked on the implementation of the linked list and storing the path fo the robot. However since we did not have time to work on driving the robot back to its initial point, we decided to meet up during reading week. We finished a large part of the program during that meet up but there were bugs in the program. We both worked individually to remove those bugs. I mainly focused on improving our wall follower code whilst Henry finished the code on driving back. Then in the lab on Thursday, we both changed our code slightly because the constants that we use in the simulator are not exactly the same on the robots.
